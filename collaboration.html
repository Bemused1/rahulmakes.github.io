<p> Figuring out the project direction: </p>


<p> This week, I set out determine the future of this project -- purely focused on providing stylized candle light, or also focusing candelight for functional purposes? So, I questioned 20 people about their preferred direction, showing them images of the current functionality (light refraction patterns) and asking about the preferred functionalities. </p>

<p> The 20 surveyed people included family, friends, and some acquaintances. The results were almost unanimously in favour of a focus on aesthetic light refraction patterns, with 18 out of the 20 people not seeing significant value in focusing candlelight for more functional purposes. It is entirely likely that this is partly due to the nature of the sample group -- my family and friends are unlikely to have required candlelight for fucntional purposes before -- it is a group that has always had ample access to electricity and bright LEDs.  </p>

<p> I did do some research into the nature of product surveys, in an attempt to determine how valuable the questioning was. What I found, was that the value was entirely questionable -- the trend is that people tend not to be aware of how they use products, and what their preferences are. It has often been the case, in other product surveys, that participants would identify a use X for the given product when questioned, and then entirely use the product for Y when observed.  </p>

<p> Discussion in section furthered my focus -- it seems that I am settling on one, beautiful object, that refracts light with an aesthetic intent. It was further highlighted that, if I were to make a lower quality press-fit product, it would be necessary to produce larger volume, for sale to more people. The problem here, is that it is not obvious that the target market is sufficiently large. It is entirely more likely that the product will see success as a very expensive high-end product for sale to enthusiasts.  </p>

<p> So, in summary: one beautiful, high-end product, not press-fit, for creating beautiful refraction patterns. </p>
