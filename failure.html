<p>  This week, I attempted to refine the selected focus into an actual product; an enclosure for candles that creates beautiful refraction patterns, focusing on the aesthetic. The ultimate plan is to create a press-fit kit, constrained such that all constructions with the kit create beautiful patterns, but still flexible enough to allow users to tailor the focus -- directing the light where necessary. Thus, this week, I designed and cut a press-fit candle enclosure, using mirrored acrylic.  </p>

<p> The first step was to fire up Fusion 360, and design the press-fit kit. The only real design note here is that, in the future, instead of using the exact thickness of the material for notches, I will use a measurement that is slightly less than the thickness (will assist in maintaining structural integrity -- with a snug fit). </p>

<p> A little laser-cutting (and plenty of CAD-fiddling later), and the pieces were cut. Note for next time: there is no need to use mirrorred acrylic for the body of the structure -- it is only necessary for the reflective component of the structure. The entire piece would probably be more aesthetically pleasing if the body were cut out of wood.  </p>

<p> Once cut, it was time for pictures. </p>
